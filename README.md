Todayâ€™s world have a fast growing population with a wide range of demand from a variety of domains. Customers who need to purchase different products in supermarkets needs lots of time and patience in coordinating among them self for successful shopping. At present, we are using the same process in shops & malls with help of a barcode scanner. Vendor scan the product through the barcode scanner. This is a slow process and Customer has to wait in queues for a long period which becomes frustrating. So, this is a one of the reason for most of the people to leave the shop even though they initially planned to purchase only a few products, but with the world getting automated in many aspects this system will ensure that the customers will have the best shopping experience and very often, they visit the shop. There is also a scope of improvement, a feature where a customer can feed in the shopping list which will enable the customer not to miss out on any item.  This shopping cart stands apart from many of the existing designs due to a variety of features. One such reason is that the conventional method of bar code scanning where an item has to be in the line of sight is replaced using RFID reader it just has to be in the vicinity and it would be detected. To conclude, the cart will enable the customer to scan the items and get the total bill instantly. This would reduce the checkout time of a customer from the billing counter.
